# Review Cycle

Automated PR review cycle until full approval.

PR number: $ARGUMENTS (if not provided — detect from the current branch via `gh pr view --json number -q .number`).

## Cycle

Repeat the following steps until the reviewer approves the PR or no comments remain:

### 1. Check for earlier open PRs

Before requesting review, check if there are open PRs with lower numbers than the current one:
```bash
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,headRefName --jq '[.[] | select(.number < PR_NUMBER)]'
```
If earlier open PRs exist — ask the user (via AskUserQuestion) how to proceed:
- **Merge earlier first** — run `/review-cycle` on the earlier PR first, then return to this one
- **Review both in parallel** — proceed with this PR while the earlier one is handled separately
- **Skip check** — ignore earlier PRs and proceed with this one

Only continue after the user responds.

### 2. Request review

Leave a comment on the PR instructing the reviewer to focus on significant issues:
```
gh pr comment <PR> --body "@claude review. Focus on critical issues: bugs, security vulnerabilities, logical errors, data loss risks, performance problems. Do NOT nitpick style, naming conventions, minor formatting, or subjective preferences — only flag issues that could break functionality or cause real harm in production."
```

### 3. Wait for reviewer response

#### 3.1. Find the bot's comment
Wait 20 seconds, then fetch issue comments and find the latest one from `claude[bot]`:
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{PR}/comments --jq '[.[] | select(.user.login == "claude[bot]")] | last | {id, created_at, body}'
```
Save the `COMMENT_ID` and `created_at` timestamp.

If no comment found — wait 20 more seconds and retry (max 3 total attempts). If still not found — notify the user and stop.

#### 3.2. Poll the comment
Every 30 seconds, check the comment body:
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/{COMMENT_ID} --jq '.body'
```
The review is complete when the body contains the string `Claude finished` (the progress checklist with checkboxes disappears from the body at this point).

#### 3.3. Timeout
Maximum wait time: 7 minutes from the comment's `created_at`. If `Claude finished` hasn't appeared by then — take the current body as final and proceed to step 4. Notify the user that the review may be incomplete.

### 4. Analyze and triage comments

Read all comments and review comments from ALL reviewers (bot and human). Fetch both issue comments and PR review comments:
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{PR}/comments --jq '[.[] | {id, user: .user.login, body, created_at}]'
gh pr view <PR> --json reviews --jq '.reviews'
```
Process comments from every reviewer, not just `claude[bot]`. If the status is "APPROVED" and there are no new comments from any reviewer — go to step 7.

Launch a subagent (Agent tool) to triage each comment. The subagent must:
- Read the current code of files referenced in the comments
- Check whether the issue was already fixed in previous commits (compare with what the reviewer is requesting)
- Assess severity: critical (bug, security, logical error) vs cosmetic (style, naming, formatting)
- Check relevance: does the comment actually relate to this PR's code? The reviewer may be mistaken — referencing non-existent files, confusing function names, or providing feedback that clearly belongs to a different project/PR. Mark such comments as `IRRELEVANT`
- Check consistency: does the comment contradict previous comments from the same or another reviewer? If the reviewer asks for X now but asked for not-X in the previous cycle — mark as `CONFLICTING`
- **Verify every claim before assigning `FIX`**: for each comment, read the actual files and grep the codebase to confirm that every statement the reviewer makes is true. Do not take any claim at face value — LLM reviewers routinely hallucinate: non-existent functions, wrong line numbers, incorrect patterns, false project-wide conventions (e.g. "only English comments", "this method doesn't exist", "this pattern is used everywhere"). A `FIX` verdict is only valid when the underlying claim is confirmed by reading the actual code. If any claim is false — mark as `HALLUCINATION`
- Return a list of comments with a verdict: `FIX` (needs fixing), `ALREADY_FIXED` (already resolved), `SKIP` (cosmetic), `IRRELEVANT` (unrelated to this PR), `CONFLICTING` (contradicts previous comments), `HALLUCINATION` (reviewer's factual claim about the codebase is verifiably false)

Only fix comments with the `FIX` verdict. For other verdicts — leave a reply comment on the PR with an explanation:
- `ALREADY_FIXED` — specify which commit already addressed the issue
- `SKIP` — explain why the comment is cosmetic and does not affect functionality
- `IRRELEVANT` — politely note that the comment does not relate to this PR's code
- `CONFLICTING` — quote the contradicting previous comment and ask the reviewer to clarify
- `HALLUCINATION` — show concrete evidence from the codebase (grep results, file contents) that disproves the reviewer's claim

### 5. Fix issues
- Only fix comments with the `FIX` verdict from step 4
- Read the files referenced in the comments
- Apply fixes
- Run linter: `ruff check src/ tests/`
- Run tests: `pytest tests/ -v`

### 6. Commit and push
- Commit fixes with a meaningful message
- Push to remote
- Return to step 2

### 7. Finalization
When the PR is approved and no comments remain:
```bash
gh pr merge <PR> --squash --delete-branch
git checkout main
git pull
```

## Important
- All `gh` commands (and any other GitHub API calls) must be run via Bash with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`, as the sandbox blocks TLS connections to api.github.com
- Do not skip critical comments — fix all with the `FIX` verdict. Cosmetic comments (`SKIP`) can be skipped with a reply
- Every commit must have a meaningful message following conventional commits style
- Run lint and tests before every commit
- If tests fail after fixes — fix them before pushing
- If the reviewer does not respond after 2 checks in a single cycle — notify the user and stop: the reviewer bot may be misconfigured or unavailable
